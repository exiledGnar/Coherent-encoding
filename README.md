# Coherent-encoding
Coded with Matlab2021a/Decode the results of the related encoding in a non-pre-encoded form
First, generate a random number using the "signal_generator" file and generate the corresponding binary sequence (rounded to the nearest integer).
Next, open the "coherent encoding" file to perform encoding and decoding.
Then, open the "output" file to restore the corresponding binary codes back to their respective numbers.
By controlling the "seed" parameter in the "signal_generator" file, you can adjust the original number.
The package includes a designed GUI file for visual and interactive purposes, and the callback needs to be supplemented.
